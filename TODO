Update your own comment
Add description to step
Add Info, help and info_text (rename if possible)
use reswap none when possible instead of returning the same object
Set completed date and user on task

V2 (refacto UI with all features presents)
Better UI
Loading component

V3 (optimisation - industrialisation)
Write unittest
Use ProjectService when possible
Allow to manage templates on the UI -- Need to align with roles :/
Review SQL, Cachcing, optimisations
