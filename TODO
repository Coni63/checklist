V0

BUG:

V1 (must have features)
use reswap none when possible instead of returning the same object

V2 (refacto UI with all features presents)
Better UI
Loading component

V3 (optimisation - industrialisation)
Write unittest
Use ProjectService when possible
Allow to manage templates on the UI -- Need to align with roles :/
Review SQL, Cachcing, optimisations
Migrate to v6
Multiple settings.py
